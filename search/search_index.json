NLBayes incorporates prior knowledge of TF-target relationships and uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to infer the posterior distributions of TF activities. Through extensive validation on simulated data and applications to real datasets, we demonstrate that NLBayes outperforms existing methods in accuracy, robustness to noise, and interpretability. We apply NLBayes to analyze TF activities in prostate cancer progression and treatment response, revealing key regulators and their dynamics.

We applied this method to investigate mitochondrial morphological changes in TNBC cells in response to chemotherapy treatment, revealing significant alterations in size, shape, cristae architecture, and spatial distribution that correlate with treatment response and resistance development. Our results demonstrate that resistant cells exhibit distinct mitochondrial phenotypes characterized by increased networking, altered cristae density, and positional reorganization within the cell.

Pathology occurs during rapid replication cycles in the asexual blood stage of infection. Current knowledge of Babesia replication cycle progression and regulation is limited and relies mostly on comparative studies with related parasites. Due to limitations in synchronizing Babesia parasites, fine-scale time-course transcriptomic resources are not readily available. Single-cell transcriptomics provides a powerful unbiased alternative for profiling asynchronous cell populations. Here, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing to 3 Babesia species (B. divergens, B. bovis, and B. bigemina). We used analytical approaches and algorithms to map the replication cycle and construct pseudo-synchronized time-course gene expression profiles. We identify clusters of co-expressed genes showing \"just-in-time\" expression profiles, with gradually cascading peaks throughout asexual development. Moreover, clustering analysis of reconstructed gene curves reveals coordinated timing of peak expression in epigenetic markers and transcription factors. Using a regularized Gaussian graphical model, we reconstructed co-expression networks and identified conserved and species-specific nodes. Motif analysis of a co-expression interactome of AP2 transcription factors identified specific motifs previously reported to play a role in DNA replication in Plasmodium species.

Phenotypic assessments of steps across the lytic cycle revealed that only traits needed in the extracellular milieu evolved. Nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in only one gene, a P4 flippase, fixated across two different evolving populations, whereas dramatic changes in the transcriptional signature of extracellular parasites were identified. Newly developed computational tools correlated phenotypes evolving at different rates with specific transcriptomic changes. A set of 300 phenotype-associated genes was mapped, of which nearly 50% is annotated as hypothetical. Validation of a select number of genes by knockouts confirmed their role in lab adaptation and highlights novel mechanisms underlying in vitro virulence traits. Further analyses of differentially expressed genes revealed the development of a \"pro-tachyzoite\" profile as well as the upregulation of the fatty acid biosynthesis (FASII) pathway. The latter aligned with the P4 flippase SNP and aligned with a low abundance of medium-chain fatty acids at low passage, indicating this is a limiting factor in extracellular parasites. In addition, partial overlap with the bradyzoite differentiation transcriptome in extracellular parasites indicated that stress pathways are involved in both situations. This was reflected in the partial overlap between the assembled ApiAP2 and Myb transcription factor network underlying the adapting extracellular state with the bradyzoite differentiation program.
