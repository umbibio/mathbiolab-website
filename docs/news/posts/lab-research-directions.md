# Future Research Directions for MathBioLab

As we approach the end of 2024, I'd like to share some thoughts on our lab's research directions for the coming year and beyond.

<!-- more -->

## Building on Our Foundation

Over the past year, our lab has made significant strides in several key areas of computational biology:

1. **Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis**: Our deep learning approaches have shown promising results in identifying cell subtypes and developmental trajectories.

2. **Multi-omics data integration**: We've developed novel network-based methods for integrating data from different molecular layers.

3. **Mathematical modeling**: Our models of gene regulatory networks have provided new insights into the dynamics of cellular processes.

## New Horizons for 2025

Looking ahead, we plan to expand our research in several exciting directions:

### Spatial Transcriptomics

Spatial transcriptomics technologies are revolutionizing our understanding of cellular organization in tissues. We aim to develop computational methods for analyzing spatial gene expression data and integrating it with other omics data types.

### AI for Drug Discovery

We're initiating a new research thrust focused on applying machine learning to drug discovery. This will involve collaboration with medicinal chemists and structural biologists to develop models for predicting drug-target interactions and optimizing lead compounds.

### Systems Medicine

Building on our expertise in systems biology, we're expanding into translational applications with a focus on personalized medicine. This will involve developing computational frameworks for integrating patient-specific data to guide clinical decision-making.

## Opportunities for Collaboration

These new research directions open up exciting opportunities for collaboration. If you're working in related areas and interested in potential collaborations, please don't hesitate to [reach out](../../contact.md).

I look forward to sharing more about these initiatives as they develop throughout 2025.
