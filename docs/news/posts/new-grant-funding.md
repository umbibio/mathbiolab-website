# New Grant Funding for Multi-omics Research

We are pleased to announce that our lab has received a significant grant to advance our research in multi-omics data integration and analysis.

<!-- more -->

## Grant Details

The National Science Foundation (NSF) has awarded our lab a $1.2 million grant to support our project titled "Integrated Computational Methods for Multi-omics Data Analysis in Complex Diseases." This three-year project will focus on developing novel computational methods for integrating and analyzing data from genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics to better understand the molecular mechanisms of complex diseases.

## Research Objectives

The grant will support the following key research objectives:

1. Develop new machine learning frameworks for integrating multi-omics data
2. Create novel network-based approaches for identifying disease biomarkers
3. Design and implement user-friendly software tools for the scientific community
4. Apply these methods to study specific diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders

## Opportunities

This funding will create new opportunities for:

- Graduate Student positions (2 PhD students)
- Postdoctoral positions (1 position)
- Undergraduate research experiences

Interested candidates should visit our [Contact](../../contact/index.md) page for information on how to apply.

We are excited about this opportunity to advance the field of multi-omics research and look forward to sharing our progress as the project develops.
