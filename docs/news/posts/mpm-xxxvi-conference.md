## About the Conference

The Molecular Parasitology Meeting is a prestigious annual event that brings together researchers from around the world to present and discuss the latest breakthroughs across all fields of molecular parasitology. This year's meeting will be held in person at the Marine Biological Laboratories (MBL) with a virtual option available for remote attendance and participation in the virtual poster session.

## Keynote Speaker

The conference will feature **Dr. Patricia J. Johnson**, Distinguished Professor of Microbiology, Immunology & Molecular Genetics at the University of California, Los Angeles, as the keynote speaker. Dr. Johnson is renowned for her work on *Trichomonas vaginalis* and has made significant contributions to the field of molecular parasitology, including the development of genetic manipulation tools and spearheading the first genome project for *T. vaginalis*.

## Conference Details

- **Dates**: September 14-18, 2025
- **Location**: Marine Biological Laboratory, 7 MBL Street, Woods Hole, MA 02543, USA
- **Format**: In-person with virtual attendance options
