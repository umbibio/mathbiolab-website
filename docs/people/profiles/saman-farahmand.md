## Biography

Dr. Saman Farahmand was a Ph.D. student and Graduate Research Assistant in the MathBioLab from 2017 to 2021. His research focused on developing innovative machine learning approaches for analyzing high-throughput molecular data in oncology research. His dissertation, titled "Machine Learning Models for Deciphering Regulatory Mechanisms and Morphological Variations in Cancer," combined deep learning techniques with computational biology to address complex biological questions.

After completing his Ph.D., Dr. Farahmand joined Takeda as a Research Scientist and has advanced to Research Senior Scientist, where he continues his work in computational biology, bioinformatics, and machine learning applications.
