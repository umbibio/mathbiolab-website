## Biography

Dr. Yasaman Rezvani was a Ph.D. student and Research Assistant in the MathBioLab from 2018 to 2023, where she focused on developing innovative computational methods for analyzing omics data. Her dissertation, titled "Analytical Approaches for Identification of Transcriptional Regulatory Programs Driving Toxoplasma Gondii Cell Division and Virulence," combined mathematical and statistical models with machine learning techniques to explore epigenetics and gene regulatory programs in parasites.

After completing her Ph.D., Dr. Rezvani joined AbbVie as a Bioinformatics Analyst II and has recently moved to nChroma Bio as a Scientist I, where she continues her work in bioinformatics and computational biology.
