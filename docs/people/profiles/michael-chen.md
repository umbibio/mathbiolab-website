## Biography

Michael joined the MathBioLab in Fall 2023 after completing his Master's degree in Computer Science at Boston University. His research focuses on developing novel machine learning methods for integrating and analyzing multi-omics datasets, with a particular interest in applications to cancer genomics.

## Current Projects

### Integrative Analysis of Multi-omics Data

Developing deep learning models that can effectively integrate data from genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics to identify biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for cancer.

### Transfer Learning for Cross-species Genomic Analysis

Investigating how transfer learning approaches can be used to leverage data from model organisms to improve predictions in human genomic studies, particularly in cases where human data is limited.
