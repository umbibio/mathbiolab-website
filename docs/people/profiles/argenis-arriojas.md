## Biography

Dr. Argenis Arriojas Maldonado is a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Center for Personalized Cancer Therapy, University of Massachusetts Boston. With a background in physics and computational sciences, his research focuses on developing computational methods and tools for analyzing complex biological data, particularly in the fields of gene regulation, single-cell genomics, and parasitology. His interdisciplinary expertise spans machine learning, Bayesian inference, and mathematical modeling of biological systems.

## Research Focus

Dr. Arriojas Maldonado develops innovative computational approaches to analyze multi-omics data and model biological systems. His current research areas include:

- Time course analysis in single-cell RNA and ATAC-seq datasets
- Visualization tools for parasite atlases
- Automated data analysis pipelines for cut-and-run, scRNA, scATAC, and single-cell multi-omics
- Deep learning models for image segmentation of cellular structures
- Bayesian inference models for transcription factor activity
- Stochastic modeling of gene expression regulation

## Current Projects

### Cell Flow: Interactive Analysis of Single-Cell Omics Data

Developing interactive tools for cell density and trajectory analysis of single-cell omics data, with applications in parasite biology research.

### Computational Analysis of Transcriptional Regulation

Working on integrated analysis of CUT&RUN and single-cell knockdown data to reveal hierarchical gene regulation in *Toxoplasma gondii*.

### AI-Enabled Analysis of Mitochondrial Morphology

Developing automated analysis pipelines to assess the impact of chemotherapy on mitochondrial morphology in triple negative breast cancer using transmission electron micrographs.
