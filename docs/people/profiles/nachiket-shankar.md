## Biography

I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Center for Personalized Cancer Therapy, University of Massachusetts Boston, where my research focuses on understanding cell division plasticity in *Apicomplexan* parasites using single-cell RNA-sequencing, chromatin accessibility data, and other high-throughput genomics approaches. I work closely with experimental biologists to develop and maintain robust pipelines for data processing and analysis, employing statistical genetics and advanced bioinformatics tools to uncover new insights into parasite biology.

In addition to my postdoctoral role, I serve as an Honorary Assistant Professor at the Trans-Disciplinary Health Sciences and Technology (TDU) in Bangalore. Through this appointment, I collaborate on research projects in molecular genetics and computational biology, as well as mentor students in these fields.

Before starting my postdoctoral work, I completed my Ph.D. in Molecular, Cellular, and Organismal Biology at UMass Boston. My doctoral research centered on plant–microbe interactions, where I utilized metagenomic selection studies in the rhizosphere of *Arabidopsis thaliana* to explore how specific plant genotypes influence soil microbial communities. I also have research experience in bacterial evolutionary genomics from my time at the National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS) in Bangalore.

## Research Focus

My work combines genomics, metagenomics, and computational biology to tackle fundamental questions in both plant and parasite systems:

- **Apicomplexan Parasitology**  
  I employ single-cell transcriptomic and epigenomic data to explore how *Toxoplasma gondii* and other Apicomplexan parasites regulate cell division and differentiation.

- **Plant–Microbe Interactions**  
  I investigate the ways in which plant genotypes influence rhizosphere microbial communities, using large-scale metagenomic analyses and statistical genetics approaches.

- **High-Performance Computing & Pipelines**  
  I develop reproducible workflows for large-scale sequencing projects, leveraging Docker, Snakemake, and HPC clusters to efficiently handle massive datasets.

- **Statistical & Evolutionary Genetics**  
  I utilize quantitative methods to study host–microbe co-evolution, bacterial genome evolution, and selection-driven shifts in microbial consortia.

## Current Projects

### 1. Single-Cell Omics in *Toxoplasma gondii*
- **Objective**: I seek to integrate single-cell RNA-seq and CUT&RUN data to create a detailed map of chromatin accessibility and transcriptional regulation during the parasite’s lytic cycle.  
- **Approach**: I build high-throughput pipelines on HPC clusters and apply downstream analytics to pinpoint key regulatory mechanisms involved in parasite replication and development.

### 2. Multi-Generation Rhizosphere Selection in *Arabidopsis thaliana*
- **Objective**: I aim to determine which plant genomic regions mediate soil microbiota composition and ultimately impact plant biomass.  
- **Approach**: I combine near-isogenic line (NIL) mapping with 16S rRNA/complete metagenomics to identify specific genetic factors that shape root-associated microbial communities.

### 3. Collaborative Initiatives in Plant Growth & Metagenomics
- **Objective**: I collaborate with international institutions (e.g., Seqomics Ltd. in Hungary) to broaden high-throughput sequencing projects investigating plant–microbe systems.  
- **Approach**: I lead multi-institutional research efforts, secure grants, and mentor undergraduate and graduate students in advanced molecular and computational techniques.
