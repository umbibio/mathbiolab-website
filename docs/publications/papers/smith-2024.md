## Abstract

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized our ability to study cellular heterogeneity, but computational analysis of these data remains challenging due to their high dimensionality, sparsity, and technical noise. In this study, we present a novel deep learning framework for comprehensive analysis of scRNA-seq data, addressing key challenges in dimensionality reduction, clustering, batch correction, and trajectory inference. Our approach leverages a variational autoencoder architecture with specific modifications tailored to the unique characteristics of scRNA-seq data. Through extensive benchmarking on diverse datasets spanning multiple tissues and technologies, we demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. Furthermore, we showcase the utility of our approach in identifying previously uncharacterized cell states in complex tissues and elucidating developmental trajectories. The method is implemented in an open-source package with a user-friendly interface, making advanced deep learning techniques accessible to biologists without extensive computational expertise.
