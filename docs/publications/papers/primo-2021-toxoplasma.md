## Abstract

Evolve and resequencing (E&R) was applied to lab adaptation of Toxoplasma gondii for over 1,500 generations with the goal of mapping host-independent in vitro virulence traits. Phenotypic assessments of steps across the lytic cycle revealed that only traits needed in the extracellular milieu evolved. Nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in only one gene, a P4 flippase, fixated across two different evolving populations, whereas dramatic changes in the transcriptional signature of extracellular parasites were identified. Newly developed computational tools correlated phenotypes evolving at different rates with specific transcriptomic changes. A set of 300 phenotype-associated genes was mapped, of which nearly 50% is annotated as hypothetical. Validation of a select number of genes by knockouts confirmed their role in lab adaptation and highlights novel mechanisms underlying in vitro virulence traits. Further analyses of differentially expressed genes revealed the development of a "pro-tachyzoite" profile as well as the upregulation of the fatty acid biosynthesis (FASII) pathway. The latter aligned with the P4 flippase SNP and aligned with a low abundance of medium-chain fatty acids at low passage, indicating this is a limiting factor in extracellular parasites. In addition, partial overlap with the bradyzoite differentiation transcriptome in extracellular parasites indicated that stress pathways are involved in both situations. This was reflected in the partial overlap between the assembled ApiAP2 and Myb transcription factor network underlying the adapting extracellular state with the bradyzoite differentiation program. Overall, E&R is a new genomic tool successfully applied to map the development of polygenic traits underlying in vitro virulence of T. gondii.

## Key Points

- Evolve and resequencing (E&R) was applied to study lab adaptation in Toxoplasma gondii over 1,500 generations
- Lab adaptation primarily affected traits needed in the extracellular environment
- Changes were primarily driven by transcriptional reprogramming rather than genetic mutations
- A set of 300 phenotype-associated genes was identified and validated through knockout studies
- Upregulation of fatty acid biosynthesis pathways and development of a "pro-tachyzoite" profile were observed
- The study demonstrates E&R as a powerful tool to map multigenic traits in parasites
