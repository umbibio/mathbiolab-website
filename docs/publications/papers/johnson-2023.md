## Abstract

The integration of multiple omics data types (e.g., genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics) offers unprecedented opportunities to understand complex biological systems. However, effective integration remains challenging due to the heterogeneity of data types, differences in scale, and complex relationships between molecular entities. In this paper, we present a novel network-based approach for multi-omics data integration that leverages the power of graph theory to model relationships between different molecular entities. Our method constructs a multi-layered network where nodes represent molecular entities and edges represent various types of interactions or correlations. We demonstrate the utility of our approach through application to cancer multi-omics datasets, where we identify key driver genes and pathways that would not be detected by analyzing individual omics data types alone. Our method outperforms existing integration approaches in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and biological relevance of the identified molecular signatures. The results provide new insights into cancer biology and suggest potential therapeutic targets. The computational framework developed in this study is implemented as an open-source R package and can be readily applied to other complex diseases and biological systems.
