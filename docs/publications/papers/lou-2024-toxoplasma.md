## Abstract

The apicomplexan parasite *Toxoplasma gondii* undergoes a lytic replication cycle that is characterized by a coordinated gene expression program orchestrated by stage-specific transcription factors. Here, we generated and analyzed comprehensive single-cell multi-omic profiles (scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq) across the lytic cycle to understand the regulatory mechanisms governing this complex developmental process. Our analysis identified distinct cell states corresponding to G1, S/M, and cytokinesis phases with specific transcriptional signatures. By integrating chromatin accessibility and gene expression data, we identified key regulatory elements and transcription factor binding sites. We characterized the essential ApiAP2 transcription factor AP2XII-8 using CUT&RUN and conditional knockdown approaches, revealing its role as a master regulator of ribosomal gene expression. AP2XII-8 depletion causes severe growth defects and dysregulation of hundreds of genes, particularly affecting ribosome biogenesis. This study provides unprecedented insights into the regulatory mechanisms underlying *T. gondii* development and highlights AP2XII-8 as a critical regulator of ribosome biosynthesis, establishing a foundation for understanding apicomplexan developmental biology through multi-omic approaches.

## Key Points

- Comprehensive single-cell multi-omic atlas of *T. gondii* lytic cycle
- Integration of scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data reveals regulatory dynamics
- Identification of AP2XII-8 as a master regulator of ribosomal gene expression
- CUT&RUN and conditional knockdown validate AP2XII-8 function
- Novel computational approaches for analyzing parasite developmental trajectories
