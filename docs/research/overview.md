# Research Overview

Our lab applies mathematical and computational approaches to understand complex biological systems. We develop and apply innovative methods in areas such as:

## Core Research Areas

### Mathematical Modeling
We develop mathematical models to describe biological processes at various scales, from molecular interactions to population dynamics.

### Computational Genomics
We analyze genomic and transcriptomic data to understand gene regulation, expression patterns, and evolutionary relationships.

### Machine Learning in Biology
We apply and develop machine learning techniques to extract insights from biological data and predict outcomes of biological processes.

### Systems Biology
We study biological systems as integrated networks, examining how components interact to produce emergent properties.

## Interdisciplinary Approach

Our research is inherently interdisciplinary, combining expertise from:
- Mathematics and Statistics
- Computer Science
- Molecular Biology
- Genetics and Genomics
